<h1>Offtop</h1>

This was my first hackathon. I managed to make only an authentication server, but I liked what I did, so I use these developments in a universal authentication server for my future projects.

<h1>DREAM DAIRY Backend</h1>

<h2>You can try my auth api</h2>

- [SERVER](https://github.com/p2034/HACK-2022-DREAM-DAIRY/blob/main/cmd/auth/AUTH.md)
  
- [API SERVER](https://github.com/p2034/HACK-2022-DREAM-DAIRY/blob/main/cmd/api/API.md)

<h2>How to use?</h2>

use make to start the server, sorry there is not to mush info, I slept about 0 hours in 2 days, it's hard for me to formulate anything

<p>You need to export this variables:</p>

```bash
export DATABASE_HOST=000.000.000.000
export DATABASE_PORT=000000
export DATABASE_USER=user
export DATABASE_PASSWORD=password
export DATABASE_NAME=dbname
```
<p>Run this to start server:</p>

```
go build .
./HACK-2022-DREAM-DAIRY auth <address>
```
